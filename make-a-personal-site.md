## Your Personal Site

If you've read Chapter 1 of the Learn Enough Git tutorial, you should be comfortable with the following statements:

* Git is a version control software
* Git transforms an ordinary folder into a repository
* Properly formatted HTML pages have `head` and `body` tags

If any one of those statements don't make sense, please re-read Chapter 1.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is an online service for projects that use Git. In addition to hosting repositories online, allowing coders to collaborate on writing code. They also provide a service called GitHub Pages that can host static websites for **free**.

Please read continue reading the Learn Enough Git tutorial and follow the instructions from Chapter 2 to Chapter 4:

* Sign up for a GitHub account
* Create a remote repository
* Familiarize yourself with the Git workflow: committing, pushing, pulling, branching and merging
* Set up your site on GitHub Pages

Congratulations, now you have a personal site!

## Next Steps

We ask that you go one step beyond the tutorial and create an extra page called `biography.html` and link to it from your main page. In the biography page, tell us a little bit about yourself \(what program you're in, what you're studying, your past experience etc.\) and also what your academic and professional interests are. You don't have to write an essay, just a few sentences would be fine!
