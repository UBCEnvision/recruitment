## The Envision Site

The UBC Envision website is hosted on GitHub Pages. We use a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build our site. You don't need to know how Jekyll works right now, but if you're interested in learning more, check out their site.

You do, however, need to know what Markdown is. Instead of pure HTML, we use Markdown to write content, and Jekyll builds HTML files from it \(hence the generator part in the name static site **generator**\).

## Forking and Pull Requests

The terms _forking_ and _pull requests_ were briefly mentioned in Chapter 4 in the Git tutorial. In this section, we'll get you to explore and practice those concepts.

Code hosted on public repositories on GitHub are open source. The best part about this is that anyone can view the code and make modifications and improvements to it. The code that runs the UBC Envision site is also open source. To make modifications to it, you'll first have to create a **fork **to copy the code into your own GitHub account, make your modifications there and then finally **create a pull request** to merge the code back into the original repository.
