# UBC Envision

UBC Envision is the AIChE \(American Institute of Chemical Engineers\) student chapter of the University of British Columbia. We started off as the [UBC Chem-E-Car](http://www.ubcchemecar.com/) team and have won numerous awards and competitions over the years. More recently, we have expanded our activities beyond Chem-E-Car and in 2017, rebranded ourselves as UBC Envision.

UBC Envision is an umbrella organization for all our projects. We started the 2017-2018 academic year strong, with 50 new and returning members across 5 projects, increased faculty engagement and a new name that reflects the breadth and diversity of our team.

Software and AI are revolutionizing many traditional fields, including chemical engineering. We recognize this trend and we are adapting. As a tech-savvy team, digital technology and software development are playing an increasingly important role across all our projects.

## Recruitment

### Lab Roles

We thank you for your interest but unfortunately, we won't be able to accommodate everyone for lab-based roles due to limited physical space. We currently do not have any openings for lab roles.

### Tech Roles

However, we are **always** looking for coders and developers to join our team! We welcome students from all backgrounds \(engineering, arts, computer science etc.\). If you're passionate about coding and committed to learning new digital trends and emerging technologies, **we want you**.

Read on for instructions on how to proceed.

## The Recruitment Process

Our [website](https://www.ubcenvision.com) shows a list of projects we are working on right now. If you're interested in one or more projects, awesome! Let's begin.

We'll assume that you're a beginner with zero to minimal experience with web development and version control. We'll need you to read some tutorials, set up some tools and complete a guided tech challenge. 

_If you're familiar with HTML and if 'forking a repo' and 'making a pull request' don't sound like gibberish to you, skip the tutorials and go straight to _[_The Challenge._](/the-challenge.md)

The entire recruitment process looks like this:

1. Read articles and work on tutorials
2. Pass technical challenge
3. Meet with leads
