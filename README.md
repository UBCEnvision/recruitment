# UBC Envision

UBC Envision is the AIChE \(American Institute of Chemical Engineers\) student chapter of the University of British Columbia. We started off as the [UBC Chem-E-Car](http://www.ubcchemecar.com/) team and have won numerous awards and competitions over the years. More recently, we have expanded our activities beyond Chem-E-Car and in 2017, rebranded ourselves as UBC Envision.

UBC Envision is an umbrella organization for all our projects. We started the 2017-2018 academic year strong, with 50 new and returning members across 5 projects, increased faculty engagement and a new name that reflects the breadth and diversity of our team.

Software and AI is revolutionizing many traditional fields, including chemical engineering. We recognize this trend and we are adapting. Digital technology and software development are playing an increasingly important role across all our projects.

## Recruitment

We won't be able to accommodate everyone for lab-based roles due to limited physical space. However, we are **always** looking for coders and developers to join our team! We welcome people from all backgrounds \(engineering, arts, computer science etc.\). If you're passionate about coding and committed to learning new trends and emerging technologies, **we want you**.
